# About Me

I am a geospatial scientist and doctoral researcher in the Spatial Analysis and Modeling (SAM) laboratory of the Geography Department at Simon Fraser University. My research interests lie at the intersection of GIS, spatial analysis, complex system modeling, and Geographic Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI). Specifically, I focus on utilizing geosimulation modeling approaches to understand different land-use systems and project possible future scenarios. In addition to my academic pursuits, I possess over a decade of diverse experience in the geospatial industry.

## Interests
In my free time, I enjoy hiking, playing video games, trying out new recipes in the kitchen, drawing, and flying drones over scenic areas. I am also passionate about social justice issues and volunteer regularly with local non-profits.
